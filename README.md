### Disclaimer & Introduction
**Disclaimer** : Obviously the overall architecture (as set in the unity's inspector) is not preserved here. I may do it in the future, I don't really know. The goal here was to make the project public and comprehensible for a trained audience.
I think this project reflect my way of doing things (programmaticaly speaking).
To report any issue you may see in the code, please go into the *Issues* tab on github where I will look that up (and thank you!!)

**Introduction** : The most interesting parts (I think) are the `SaveSystem` and the `GameEditor` system.
